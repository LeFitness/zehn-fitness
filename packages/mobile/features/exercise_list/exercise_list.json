    "description": "The bent-arm barbell pull-over was a staple exercise of the \"Golden Era\" of bodybuilding and a favorite of Arnold Schwarzenegger himself. Done properly, the exercise targets the pecs, lats, and serratus anterior muscles. Old-school bodybuilders would perform them with light weights for sets of 20 between sets of heavy 20-rep squats, but pull-overs are more popular today in moderate rep ranges, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body workout.",

    "description": "Lower back self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other \"trigger point\" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the quadratus lumborum or spinal erector (erector spinae) muscles of the lower back, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight area to relax or \"release.\" Lower back SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the glutes or piriformis muscles, or by stretches that target the piriformis or hips. However, some people find that SMR on the lower back can aggravate existing pain or injury, so be cautious when performing it.",

This can help increase pressing strength and prevent injury. It also helps develop the serratus anterior, an often-neglected muscle around the ribcage that can aid in shoulder health and upper-body muscle definition. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.",
